# Final-Project-CogoliDees
Final project repository for final project cs2100 and machine learning.

This project is a machine learning model that can detect and sort video game genres into categories such as, Action, RPG, Puzzle, Horror, Adventure, Sports, Simulation, Shooter, etc. The model will recognize keywords within the description or game tags to help identify genre. User will search for any keywords they like, and the model will give a list of games based on a similar genre and give descriptions. The main idea is for the user to be able to search for any game they would like, using simple keywords. For example, if the user searches for ‘zombies’, the model will respond with games under the Horror genre.
